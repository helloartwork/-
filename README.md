# HELLO ARTWORK!/-/
Handpicked NFT Artworks in #Grayscale #Monochrome #BlackandWhite

Every month, I plan to publish my own journal of contemporary artworks from NFT artists around the world. 

There are images on the page that are already on different NFT marketplaces and have been copyrighted by 
the respective artists. A link on the page directly redirects you to their respective NFT marketplaces. 

The website is a simple static one-pager, and anyone can use the code to create their own art journal.
